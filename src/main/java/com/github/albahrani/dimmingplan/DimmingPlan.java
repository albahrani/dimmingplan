/**
 * <h1>DimmingPlan</h1>
 * <p>
 * A dimming plan allows you to define a continuous and interpolated timetable
 * for one day. you are then able to retrieve the according percentage value for
 * each point in time you need.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You may define several {@link DimmingPlanChannel}s with each following its
 * own definitions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A {@link DimmingPlanChannel} predefines several times {@link LocalTime} with
 * certain percentage values <i>0.0d - 100.0d</i>, for the times in between the
 * percentage values are interpolated.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Since the {@link DimmingPlanChannel} currently is only supporting a daily
 * schedule, it also interpolates between the last defined time of day and the
 * first time of day.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link DimmingPlan} is filled {@link #channel(String)} method to create a
 * new or access an existing channel. It must be completed by calling
 * {@link #interpolate()} <b>at least once</b>. It is no problem calling it
 * multiple times or even changing the plan again, but it always has to be
 * accepted by calling {@link #interpolate()} afterwards.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h1>Example:</h1>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * DimmingPlan plan = DimmingPlan.create();
 * plan.channel("ch1").define(LocalTime.of(6, 0), 0.0d).define(LocalTime.of(8, 0), 100.0d);
 * plan.interpolate();
 * </code>
 * ...
 * <code>
 * plan.channel("ch1").getValue(LocalTime.of(6, 0));
 * </code>
 * </pre>
